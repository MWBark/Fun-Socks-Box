# Fun Socks Box

Fun Socks Box is a B2C (business to customer) e-commerce site that focuses primarily on a monthly subscription service delivering a box of three unique socks each month to subscribed registered customers. There is also an option for any customer to purchase the socks individually or all three as a gift box, though this is more expensive per sock than the monthly subscription cost, plus free delivery is only available for 3 socks or more. 

According to the online e-commerce platform Shopify in their blog article titled ‘20 Trending Products and Things to Sell Online (2024)’ found [here](https://www.shopify.com/uk/blog/trending-products?term=&adid=595096101745&campaignid=17075828612&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInsKR2qKfiQMV36BaBR2QEi4gEAAYASAAEgKmivD_BwE&cmadid=516586848;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324286430;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011#10), listing the top 20 trending products sold by US Shopify merchants, socks are simple yet profitable choice for e-commerce brands.
